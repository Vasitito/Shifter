# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
    This particular implementation has the ability to shift right or left the input based on the invert bit. The invert bit determines as to whether the input is placed in the higher or lower order bits. For the shift amount two bits are available giving a range between 0 and 3 for the available shifting moves. The result is depicted in the seven segment display where every led depicts the bit position of the final number. For example, if the final result is the number 5, then the leds that are going to light up are the 2 and 0, because the number 5 is represented with the binary 00000101.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Set invert for the mode of shifting and bits 6-7 for the amount of shifting. Then insert the 5-bit input in which the shifting is going to be performed.
